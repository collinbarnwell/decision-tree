CSV Files
==================================

I added a second line to the csv files to indicate which attributes were nominal(1) and which aren't(left blank) for each column

Example Line 1 and Line 2:

winpercent, oppwinpercent, weather, temperature, numinjured, oppnuminjured, startingpitcher, oppstartingpitcher, dayssincegame, oppdayssincegame, homeaway, rundifferential, opprundifferential, winner
,,1,,,,1,1,,,1,,,

==================================
RUNNING THE CODE:
==================================


On any machine that has Ruby installed
Go into the ruby console (irb) and load the file:

>> load 'decisionTree.rb'

--
To build grow a tree w/ data from "btrain.csv", then test it against data 
in "bvalidate.csv", run:

>> TreeBuilder.buildAndTest("btrain.csv", "bvalidate.csv")

This will print testing accuracy for both the pruned and unpruned versions 
of the tree.

--
To print the tree in Disjunctive normal form, run the same thing w/ 
one more arg set to true:


>> TreeBuilder.buildAndTest("btrain.csv", "bvalidate.csv", true)
--

--
To write predictions to a file (replacing question marks with prediction),
run: TreeBuilder.predict(training-data, prune-data, test-data, output-filename)

EX:
>> TreeBuilder.predict('btrain.csv', 'bvalidate.csv', 'btest.csv', "PS2-Collin-Barnwell.csv")
